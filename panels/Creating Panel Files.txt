Download alignments from the LANL website to use as the panel files.

Alignment type: Compendium
Organism: HIV-1/SIVcpz
Regions: User-defined range (see below)
Subtype: All M Group (A-K + Recombinants)
DNA/Protein: DNA
Year: 2019
Format:Fasta

Set HXB2 coordinates to encompass your amplicon with a little extra on either side
Examples:
GP: 600-3600
POL: 1600-5600
REN: 5800-9200
REN: 5000-9200

Align your cDNA and 2nd rd fwd primers then trim alignment to remove the primer sequences.
This leaves the alignment the exact size of your amplicon. 

Strip all columns that have gaps in >90% of sequences. 
In Geneious: Tools -> Mask Alignment -> "Save a copy with sites stripped", "Sites containing "Gaps (%)" 90%" -> OK

Give stripped alignment new unique name (preferably listing 2nd rd Primers) and upload to the
panel directory.
